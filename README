Twitter re-make created for my modern web development course. 

Makes calls to a REST API to allow user to tweet, retweet, quote, favorite, and reply to another user's tweets. 
It also displays all other user's tweets, retweets, and favorites. 
Tweets can be deleted, while retweets and favorites can also be undone. 

The application uses jQuery and AJAX to make calls to the API to receive JSON data.
